# Weather-Prediction

In this project I have made a detailed analysis as well as a prediction model so that we can predict the weather.
Since we have a good amount of data present to forecast weather, we can use big data to analyze the data for hidden 
patterns. The WeatherAUS file is data file on which preprocessing was done and then data cleaning to get clean data 
for our prediction model. Then logistic Regression was used using k-fold cross validation method to predict the rainfall
on a given set of data.
